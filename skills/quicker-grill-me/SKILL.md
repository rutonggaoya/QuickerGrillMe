# QuickerGrillMe

Turn an incomplete proposal into shared design understanding without exhaustive interrogation. Ask only when plausible answers materially change behavior, architecture, cost, risk, or scope.

## Operating workflow

### 1. Establish factual context

Read the user's proposal and inspect available code, configuration, documentation, repository state, and local environment before forming questions. Resolve discoverable facts yourself. Do not ask the user for file contents, framework versions, existing conventions, or other facts available through the host's tools.

Separate:

- **Facts** established from the proposal or environment.
- **Material decisions** that require user intent.
- **Defaults** the Agent can choose safely.
- **Unknowns** that need later evidence rather than preference.

Do not begin implementing the resulting design during this skill. The final step is explicit confirmation of shared understanding.

### 2. Select only material questions

For every candidate question, apply the counterfactual materiality test:

1. Identify at least two realistic answers.
2. State the concrete design delta caused by each answer.
3. Reject the question if the delta is merely wording, personal preference, or a cheap reversible detail.
4. Keep it only if answers change a boundary, hard-to-reverse architecture, core behavior, interface, failure mode, security posture, operating cost, scope, or material delivery risk.
5. When a reasonable default is safe, reversible, and cheap to validate, choose it and put it in the default ledger instead of asking.

Choose a depth and enforce its hard cap:

| Depth | Target | Hard cap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Essential | 5-7 | 7 |
| Standard | 10-15 | 15 |
| Deep | 20-25 | 25 |

Standard is the default. Use Essential for narrow or low-risk work. Use Deep only for high-risk, cross-system, security-sensitive, or hard-to-reverse designs. Do not add filler to reach a target.

### 3. Generate and validate questionnaire JSON

Create a working-artifact directory in the user's project or host temp area, never inside the installed skill. Start from `assets/questionnaire.template.json` and conform to `references/questionnaire.schema.json`.

Each question must include:

- dependency and stage metadata;
- impact and complexity;
- realistic options;
- one preselected recommendation with rationale and confidence;
- explicit defer behavior with a temporary default, confidence, and observable validation trigger;
- affected design decisions.

Order prerequisites before dependents. Prefer high-impact unresolved decisions. Use conditional visibility when a downstream decision is relevant only for a particular upstream answer.

Resolve `SKILL_DIR` as the absolute directory containing this `SKILL.md`; do not assume the current working directory or a particular installer location. Quote every path because installed paths may contain spaces.

Validate before serving:

```text
node "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/runtime/cli.js" validate "<questionnaire-path>"
```

Fix every reported issue. Do not weaken or bypass validation.

### 4. Run the bundled local questionnaire

Start the browser runtime in a terminal/background process that can remain alive while the user answers:

```text
node "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/runtime/cli.js" serve "<questionnaire-path>" --output "<answers-path>" --round 1
```

The runtime chooses a loopback port, opens the browser, persists the answer artifact atomically, and exits after successful submission. It uses only bundled JavaScript and browser assets; do not run `npm install`, `npm run build`, or code from the source tree.

Tell the user briefly that the questionnaire opened and wait for submission. If automatic opening fails, provide the printed `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` URL. After the process exits, read and validate the resulting answers artifact against `references/answers.schema.json`. Reconcile the answers with the factual context; do not merely restate questionnaire labels.

If a browser cannot be used, present the ordered questions in the host UI or chat. Preserve recommendations, depth caps, dependency/visibility rules, defer metadata, changed-answer review, and the answer contract. Ask primarily for changes from recommendations.

### 5. Decide whether round two is warranted

Do not create a second round merely because the user changed recommendations. Round two is allowed only when round-one answers reveal:

1. answers that cannot both be satisfied;
2. an answer that invalidates a key premise used to generate round one; or
3. an unresolved high-risk unknown whose plausible outcomes require materially different designs.

When triggered, generate exactly one final questionnaire with 3-5 material follow-ups, use a distinct questionnaire and answer path, and run:

```text
node "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/runtime/cli.js" serve "<round-2-questionnaire-path>" --output "<round-2-answers-path>" --round 2
```

Never exceed two rounds. Prefer a temporary default and validation plan when another question would not resolve the uncertainty.

### 6. Produce the final design

Stop questioning when every high-impact decision is answered or has an explicit temporary default, remaining unknowns are reversible or have validation plans, no contradiction remains, and round two is complete or was not triggered.

Produce one coherent design containing:

1. goals, scope, and non-goals;
2. architecture, interfaces, data flow, and core behavior;
3. failure handling, security, operations, rollout, and validation strategy as applicable;
4. a decision summary with selected options and material consequences;
5. **Defaults and assumptions** containing only defaults that materially affect behavior, cost, or risk;
6. **Deferred validation items**, each with temporary default, confidence, owner if known, and trigger;
7. a **Default ledger appendix** containing every chosen default, including reversible low-impact choices.

Call out unresolved risk plainly. Keep the design proportionate to the proposal; this workflow is not a new framework, approval system, or hosted service.

Persist that complete design as `final-design.md` in the working-artifact directory; do not leave the only copy in chat. Then generate a self-contained, read-only review page containing both the final design and the complete questionnaire decision record:

```text
node "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/runtime/cli.js" render-review "<questionnaire-path>" "<answers-path>" "<final-design.md-path>" --output "<design-review.html-path>"
```

The HTML makes no external requests and is ready to upload to a static host. It does not implement authentication. Because the intended access is organization members or invited reviewers, publish it only through a host that enforces those permissions. If no approved host or publisher integration is available, provide both artifact paths and do not upload them to a public service.

End by giving the user the persisted Markdown and review-page paths, then ask them to confirm that the design captures the shared understanding. Do not implement until that confirmation is received.
